# webp-to-avif
Walks a directory structure, creating avif versions of any webp images found.

To use, run the script with the directory you want to traverse passed as --dir:

```
node ./webp-to-avif.js --dir ~/Desktop/Test
```

The script isn't super fast, but gets the job done. Use or abuse however you like, but I don't intend to actively maintain so don't bother filing issues.
